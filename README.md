Production and Supplying Managment
The main idea of the software is to find a solution to the production that factories have to make. As the production is hard without having a good idea of the demands that the clients wants for the productions. Our soultion is an implimentation of a E-store that is connected to the main program, by inputing the orders with using their own formula they can predict the amounts od supplys that they need to make the production. On top of that taking on consideration the 2,3 previous years for that month we can find an average that can be like a blueprint for the factory to have supplies.
